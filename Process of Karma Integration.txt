Building the Karma template application.
This project assumes both node.js and bower have been previously installed. 

1. Create a new folder. 
2. Copy all files (and folders) in this project to it. 
3. run 	npm install
4. run 	bower install
5. run 	karma init karma.conf.js
6. update the js paths for angular, angular-mock, test/spec/**/*.js and main.js
7. update the browser launcher plugin name if required
8. run 	karma start karma.conf.js

How to load additional broswer plugins (e.g. Firefox). 

Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/karma-launcher

Look for the launcher you need. I was looking for Firefox and then click on the link to 
see the npm install command for your browser. 

Firefox was: 
npm install karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
but I'm going to use 
npm install -g karma-firefox-launcher 
instead so it's set globally.
